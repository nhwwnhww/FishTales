# FishTales
Fishing is a hugely popular past-time activity among many Australian citizens, with many loving to spend their days around a lake or river with a rod in hand. But the only thing better than reeling in that big catch is being able to show others your haul!As such there was an idea to create an application to allow the fisher-people of Queensland to be able to identify their fish by comparing with a database of known species, and then post their catch online for friends to see. A proof of concept is required to demonstrate the planning and data transfer functionality of this new web application.
